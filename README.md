This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It's a Ruby program designed to manage event attendees, generate thank you letters, and analyze registration data.

## Features

- **Thank You Letter Generation:** The program reads attendee data from a CSV file, generates personalized thank you letters using ERB templates, and saves them as HTML files.
- **Legislator Information Retrieval:** It utilizes the Google Civic Information API to retrieve information about legislators based on attendees' zip codes.
- **Data Analysis:** The program analyzes registration data to find the most frequent registration hour and day, as well as cleans and retrieves phone numbers.
